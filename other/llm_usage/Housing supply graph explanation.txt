Here’s a paragraph describing the housing supply figure and its implications:

**Figure Description and Implications:**  
Figure @fig-housing-supply illustrates the trends in housing supply, measured in months of supply, from 2006 to 2024. The graph highlights sharp fluctuations during major economic events. In the aftermath of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, housing supply spiked to over 12 months, reflecting a surplus of available homes due to decreased demand and widespread foreclosures. However, as the economy began recovering, supply steadily declined, hitting a low point around 2018. This downward trend in supply coincided with robust demand, driven by low interest rates and favorable borrowing conditions.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a combination of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and heightened demand for housing led to a sharp decline in supply, reaching historic lows. Post-2022, the supply began to rise again, likely due to reduced affordability as a result of rising interest rates (as seen in Figure @fig-interest-rate) and cooling housing market activity. These trends underscore the complex relationship between economic conditions, monetary policy, and housing market dynamics. Notably, the sharp increases in interest rates post-2022 appear to have alleviated supply constraints, although affordability remains a significant challenge.

This paragraph ties the trends in housing supply to key economic events and connects it to interest rate dynamics from the earlier figure. Let me know if you’d like to refine or expand on it!
