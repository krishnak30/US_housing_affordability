user: can you make a DAG similar to the picture I've attached, but for my model. 

chatgpt: Hereâ€™s the simplified code for your DAG without unobserved confounders:

```R
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph DAG {
  
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = circle, style = filled, color = lightblue]
  
  'CPI' [label = 'CPI']
  'Interest Rate' [label = 'Interest Rate']
  'Housing Supply' [label = 'Housing Supply']
  'Affordability Index' [label = 'Affordability Index']
  
  // Add edges
  'CPI' -> 'Affordability Index'
  'Interest Rate' -> 'Affordability Index'
  'Housing Supply' -> 'Affordability Index'
}

")
```

### Steps:
1. Run the above code in R.
2. The DAG will display the direct relationships between the predictors (`CPI`, `Interest Rate`, `Housing Supply`) and the outcome variable (`Affordability Index`).

This simplified DAG aligns directly with your model. Let me know if you need further tweaks!

user: an you write the code for the dag similar to this code and save it as a file, because otherwise i would have to render to HTML:

# Define the causal model

    F [label = 'Unobserved Confounders']
