user: Figure @fig-affordability-index presents the trends in the affordability index from 2006 to 2024, illustrating fluctuations in the cost of housing relative to wages. The affordability index is a key metric that represents the number of work hours required to afford a house, with higher values indicating greater financial strain on individuals. The index shows notable volatility over time, particularly during key economic events. From 2008 to 2011, the index declined significantly, reflecting improved affordability during the global financial crisis, likely due to falling house prices and stabilizing wages. However, affordability worsened from 2012 onwards, as the index steadily increased, peaking around 2020. This peak coincides with rising house prices during the pandemic-driven housing boom, requiring more work hours to afford a home. Post-2020, the index shows a downward trend, reflecting corrections in housing prices amid rising interest rates. This graph underscores the complex relationship between wages, housing prices, and macroeconomic factors, highlighting the persistent challenges households face in achieving affordable housing.
