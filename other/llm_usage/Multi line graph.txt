User: ok im gonna start with the multi line graph. Can we make something like this for CPI and interest rates?

Hereâ€™s the code to create a multi-line graph for **CPI** and **Interest Rates** using ggplot2 in R, similar to the one you've shared:

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Load the cleaned data
library(arrow)
analysis_data <- read_parquet("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Plotting CPI and Interest Rates over time
ggplot(data = analysis_data, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `CPI (Index)`, color = "CPI (Index)"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Interest Rate (%)` * 50, color = "Interest Rate (%)"), size = 1) + # Scale interest rates for visualization
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "CPI (Index)",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / 50, name = "Interest Rate (%)")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Trends in CPI and Interest Rates Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.title.y = element_text(color = "blue"),
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "red"),
    legend.position = "top"
  )
```

### Explanation:
- **`geom_line`**: Adds the two lines (one for CPI and one for Interest Rates).
- **Scaling**: Since CPI values are much larger than Interest Rates, the latter is scaled by multiplying/dividing to ensure both are visible.
- **Dual Axis**: The secondary axis (for Interest Rates) is added with `sec_axis`.
- **Colors**: The lines are color-coded with a legend.

### Outcome:
The graph will show CPI and Interest Rates on the same timeline, scaled appropriately for visibility, similar in style to the one you've shared.

# Load the necessary library

# CPI graph
cpi_plot <- ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = Date, y = `CPI (Index)`)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "CPI Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "CPI (Index)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Interest Rate graph
interest_rate_plot <- ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = Date, y = `Interest Rate (%)`)) +
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Interest Rate Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Interest Rate (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Combine the plots side by side
cpi_plot + interest_rate_plot
