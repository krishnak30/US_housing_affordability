user: i wanna do two graphs, let me know what you think:

1) graphing the housing supply over time. I like this code for it:

#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-interest-rate
#| fig-cap: 'Federal Funds Effective Interest Rate Over Time'

library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(arrow)

ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = Date, y = House Supply (Month's Supply))) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date(c("2008-01-01", "2020-03-01")), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Housing Supply Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Month's Supply") +
  theme_minimal()

but instead of a dashed line, do you think we can shade the area in light grey when the recessions happened? so the financial crisis adn the covid pandemic. Can we shade them instead? 

chatgpt: 

library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(arrow)

# Define recession periods
recessions <- data.frame(
  start = as.Date(c("2008-01-01", "2020-03-01")),
  end = as.Date(c("2009-06-01", "2021-12-01"))
)

# Plot with shaded recession areas
ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = Date, y = `House Supply (Month's Supply)`)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1) +
  geom_rect(data = recessions, inherit.aes = FALSE,
            aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf),
            fill = "grey", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Housing Supply Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Month's Supply"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
