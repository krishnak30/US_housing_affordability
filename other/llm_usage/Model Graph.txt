User: can you make a graph depicting the model coefficients and confidence intervals as well?


chatgpt: 

library(modelsummary)

modelplot(
  list("Model 1" = model1, "Model 2" = model2, "Model 3" = model3),
  coef_omit = "(Intercept)"
) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Comparison of Coefficients Across Models",
    x = "Estimate",
    y = "Predictor Variables"
  )
