User: ok so i have attached the pdf of my paper so far. 

additionally, i will give you two examples of discussion section:

1) the following is the abstract of a paper: abstract: "This paper examines household poverty status in the United States in 2019 using the 2019 Revised Supplemental Poverty Measure Research Dataset from the United States Census Bureau. Using logistic regression analysis, we investigate the influence of household income level and mortgage state on poverty status. Our findings reveal a higher likelihood of poverty for households' total annual income less than $50000, while all households with incomes exceeding $100000 are not in poverty. Also, renters is more likely to be in poverty compared to property owners. These insights emphasize the need for targeted interventions to address socioeconomic inequalities and promote financial well-being among US households."

## Relationship betwen Mortgage State and Poverty Status
In the USA in 2019, housing costs accounted for more than 30% of household expenditure, making mortgage status a critical factor in determining a family's risk of falling into poverty [@Statistics_2020]. A study shows that in 2019, the annual income needed are: $29,080 for a family of four with a mortgage; $24,413 for a family of four without a mortgage; and $29,194 for a family of four renting [@Khattar_Pathak_Schweitzer_Khan_McManus_Jones_Benson_Kelly_2023]. From this, we can see that families without mortgages experienced the lowest housing costs, leaving more funds available for other essentials. In contrast, families with mortgages may face expensive monthly payments, especially if they have chosen a floating interest rate, making them vulnerable to rising interest rates. Renters also experience challenges when the rent increases. So they either have to accept higher housing costs or waste time and energy to find new homes. This supports my model result that renters are more likely to be in poverty, followed by owners with mortgage, then owners without mortgage.

Also, low-income households have a harder time to access lower mortgage rates and reduce debt burdens through refinancing. Households with low to moderate incomes were less able to take advantage of lower mortgage rates and relieve their debt burdens through refinancing during the period of exceptionally low rates: only 24% of mortgages in low-income regions underwent refinancing, in contrast to the 42% in high-income areas [@mortgage]. Therefore, it is generally harder for low-income households to repay their mortgage than higher income households. The challenge of paying mortgage might increase household's likelihood to be in poverty. We can see that these problems with housing make it more likely for families which are already in poverty, to become poorer. So it is important to make housing more affordable for people, in order to help people out of poverty.

## Relationship betwen Income and Poverty Status
The relationship between a household's income after tax and its poverty status is characterized by a negative correlation, wherein higher income corresponds to a reduced probability of experiencing poverty. This correlation shows the role of financial resources in mitigating economic hardship and facilitating socio-economic well-being. In 2019, the poverty guideline for a one-person household was set at $12,490 annually [@ASPE]. So, it is evident that families earning less than $5,000 are definitely living below the poverty line. This is supported by my model result. Individuals with high incomes are less likely to experience poverty, as their financial resources enable them to comfortably cover living expenses. They will be able to have savings accumulation, further consolidating their financial security and contributing to wealth accumulation over time.

In the United States, the cost of living is notably high, low-income households often struggle to meet basic needs, resulting in an unending cycle of poverty. About half of lower-income parents (52%) say they have not had enough money for food or their rent or mortgage. 45% of employed parents with lower incomes say they would be very worried about losing pay if they needed to take a day or two off from work to deal with a sick child or because of child care issues [@Braga_2022]. This type of delimma for low-income households makes them harder to pull themselves out of poverty.

## US Government Programs to Help
For household in poverty, escaping poverty is tough, but the US government and communities are stepping up to help. For example, single parents often struggle with low incomes. But they can get help from government programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) [@snap], commonly known as food stamps, which provides eligible low-income individuals and families with funds to purchase nutritious food. They can also receive child support payments to help cover expenses for their kids. Families with low incomes and lots of kids can also get help. Programs like the Child Tax Credit (CTC) [@ctc], which provides tax credits to eligible families with qualifying children. The credit currently provides up to $2,000 per child to about 40 million families every year [@child]. So obviously, these programs are a huge help for low-income family with kids. Other programs, like housing assistance and Medicaid, provide support with things like affordable housing and healthcare. These programs are all aimed at helping families in need to get back on their feet and improve their poverty situation.

## Limitations

### Measurement of Medical Subsidies
Even the SPM accounts for expenses for healthcare and insurance by subtracting them from family resources, it does not directly value health insurance provided as a resource [@spm]. The treatment of medical expenses does not take account of all the economic effects of subsidized medical care, for example, there are families who purchase a less expensive insurance plan and decide to give up some health care. Moreover, some of the largest non-cash benefits programs (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) are not explicitly taken into account when determining poverty status. 


### Lump sum nature of tax credit
In the SPM, taxes paid and tax credits in the year that are earned are included [@spm]. But typically the credit would not appear in the family income until the next year. Also, tax credits are given as a lump sum, but poverty is a something that might happen anytime in the year. For example, a family may experience poverty because someone lost a job and cannot find another, so the family is in poverty. The tax credit may or may not provide relief depending on the timing in the year and the severity of expenses faced by the family throughout the year. So it is not very accurate that the SPM examine resources in a full calendar year compared with a threshold based on the calendar year. The family might have experienced 11 months of poverty before they got their tax credits in the 12th month.

## Future Steps
Future research should focus on gathering more inclusive and representative data by increasing the volume of data entries and mitigating bias in data collection. Beyond simply collecting data about household financial data, researchers should investigate more government benefits and expenses that are imposed on households. By investigating those benefits and expenses, researchers can arrive at conclusions if the current government poverty policies are effective for household in poverty. It is important to ensure that households in poverty have access to the necessary resources and support by the US government. This makes sure that the research not only analyzes the situation, but also contributes to actionable improvements for those affected.

2) this is the abstract of the second paper: abstract: >
  This study employs a poll-of-polls approach to predict support for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, focusing on key battleground states to forecast the likely winner of the electoral college. By aggregating multiple polls and applying a weighted linear regression model with predictors like pollster reliability, sample size, state, and recency, we estimate higher national support for Trump than Harris. Our analysis also shows a close competition in battleground states, with Trump holding a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Harris leads in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These findings show the value of aggregating polls over relying on individual surveys, offering a robust forecast of electoral outcomes.

and this is the discussion section of the same paper: # Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Key Findings

This paper predicts the support for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election using a “poll-of-polls” approach. By aggregating multiple polls, we reduce the influence of individual surveys' biases and create a more accurate and balanced forecast across candidates. Our model uses predictors, such as pollster, sample size, state, and recency of the polls. We applied a weighting scheme based on each pollster’s numeric grade and poll score which takes into consideration reliability and bias. This weighted approach produces a prediction of candidate support that reflects variations across different states and polling organizations.

One main finding from our analysis is the importance of poll recency. Including recency notably increased the model’s explanatory power, with improvements in R² and reductions in RMSE compared to models without it. This underscores the dynamic nature of public opinion, where recent events can influence voter perceptions and candidate support.

Our state-level analysis highlights close competition observed in key battleground states, emphasizing their pivotal role in the 2024 election. Our model shows that in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, support levels for Harris and Trump are nearly tied, reflecting the intense contest for these electoral votes. The predictions show that even minor shifts in support within these swing states could decisively impact the overall election outcome. This analysis shows the importance of regional polling in capturing voter sentiment and the heightened influence that battleground states hold in shaping the final results.

## Polling Uncertainty in 2024 Election

Polling provides a general sense of public opinion, but it shouldn’t be viewed as a guaranteed predictor of election outcomes. Past U.S. elections show why polls can be misleading. For example, in 2016, polls showed Hillary Clinton in the lead. According to national polls, Clinton would have won the popular vote by about 3.2% [@durand]. However, Donald Trump won battleground states, surprising many who relied on those predictions [@silver]. Trump won the electoral vote with 306 votes, while Clinton had 232 [@durand].

In 2020, 93% of national polls overestimated support for President Joe Biden [@kennedy]. Biden's lead was especially overestimated in states like Florida and Wisconsin, where Trump performed better than expected [@edwards]. These examples highlight the limitations of polls, especially when they can't capture late shifts in voter preferences, changes in turnout, and the difficulty of reaching a representative sample [@pew]. While polls can show trends, they are not always reliable for predicting what will happen on election day.
## Trump and Harris' Path to Victory

Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have potential paths to victory in the 2024 election. For Trump, one factor is the “shy voter” effect, where some supporters may be hesitant to share their views with pollsters due to social pressures. This can lead to polls underestimating his actual support [@woodie]. Additionally, Trump’s base includes groups that are harder to reach through standard polling, such as rural voters and individuals who avoid mainstream media [@brown]. These voters may be underrepresented in polls but can play an important role in election outcomes.

On the other hand, Kamala Harris could secure a win if her campaign mobilizes specific demographics, including young people, women, and minority voters. As the first Black and South Asian woman on a presidential ticket, Harris’s candidacy may energize these groups and boost turnout among historically Democratic-leaning voters [@pew]. The growing diversity and youth of the electorate could also benefit her, especially in urban areas and battleground states [@blow]. With strong efforts in voter registration and mobilization, Harris could turn polling support into actual votes, providing her with a strong chance at victory if turnout aligns with her campaign’s goals.

## Weaknesses and Future Directions

Our model assumes linear relationships between predictors and candidate support, which might not capture more complex or interaction-based trends. Additionally, while we weighted polls based on their numeric grades, these scores may not fully reflect each pollster’s accuracy, leaving room for improvement. Future research could explore non-linear methods, such as machine learning, to capture potential interactions between variables. Refining the weighting mechanism by considering pollster performance history or state-specific polling differences could further enhance predictive accuracy.

In conclusion, this paper contributes to election forecasting by providing a weighted estimate of candidate support across both national and state levels. The evolving nature of voter sentiment and poll accuracy suggests the need for adaptive models that take into consideration ongoing changes in public opinion.

#### What is Done in this Paper
This paper investigates the factors influencing housing affordability in the United States from 2006 to 2024. By combining five economic datasets from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), we constructed an Affordability Index that measures the number of work hours required to purchase a median-priced home. Through linear regression modeling, we examined the effects of inflation (CPI), housing supply, and interest rates on housing affordability. The paper highlights the evolving relationship between these factors and affordability, presenting a comprehensive analysis of their individual and collective impacts.

#### Key Findings
Our analysis reveals several critical insights:
1. **CPI and Inflation**: Inflation, as measured by CPI, significantly affects housing affordability, with higher inflation increasing the affordability index, reflecting diminished affordability. This underscores the economic burden posed by rising consumer prices, which often drive up housing costs.
2. **Housing Supply**: An increase in housing supply improves affordability, as evidenced by the negative coefficient for this variable. This aligns with economic expectations, as greater supply alleviates housing shortages and stabilizes prices.
3. **Interest Rates**: Rising interest rates were shown to significantly worsen affordability, likely due to higher mortgage rates increasing the cost of borrowing for homebuyers. The strong positive coefficient for interest rates highlights the sensitivity of affordability to monetary policy changes.

#### Weaknesses of the Analysis
While the model provides valuable insights, it is not without limitations:
1. **Model Fit**: The adjusted \(R^2\) values, while informative, indicate that only 37% to 46% of the variation in the affordability index is explained by the predictors. This suggests that other unobserved factors, such as government policies, regional variations, or demographic shifts, may also play a role in determining housing affordability.
2. **Residual Diagnostics**: Diagnostic plots reveal slight violations of linear model assumptions, such as minor deviations in homoscedasticity and normality. These issues, though not severe, may marginally affect the reliability of the inferences drawn from the model.
3. **Data Aggregation**: The national-level data used in this study may obscure important regional trends and disparities in housing affordability, which are critical for understanding local market dynamics.

#### Future Directions
Future research should address the following areas:
1. **Incorporating Additional Variables**: Including predictors such as government subsidies, zoning policies, and demographic factors could enhance the explanatory power of the model.
2. **Exploring Regional Data**: Conducting analyses at the state or metropolitan level could provide more granular insights into housing affordability trends and disparities across the U.S.
3. **Advanced Modeling Techniques**: Employing non-linear or interaction-based models, such as machine learning, could better capture the complex relationships between variables and improve predictive accuracy.

In conclusion, this paper contributes to understanding the drivers of housing affordability in the U.S., emphasizing the interplay of inflation, supply, and interest rates. While the findings align with economic theory, addressing the model's limitations and exploring new avenues for research can provide deeper insights and actionable solutions for policymakers and stakeholders.

### Discussion

#### What is Done in this Paper

This paper investigates housing affordability in the United States over the period 2006–2024 by developing a novel Affordability Index. The index measures the number of hours of work required to purchase a median-priced home and serves as a comprehensive metric for gauging the accessibility of homeownership across time. Using linear regression, this study examines the influence of key economic variables—Consumer Price Index (CPI), housing supply, and interest rates—on housing affordability. These factors were chosen because they capture inflationary pressures, supply constraints, and monetary policy, which are all fundamental drivers of housing market dynamics.

To conduct the analysis, data from five reliable sources, including FRED, was compiled and processed to align temporal and unit measurements. The model specifications were carefully designed to progressively evaluate the contribution of each predictor, starting with CPI as a standalone variable, followed by the inclusion of housing supply, and finally incorporating interest rates. This approach allowed for a clearer understanding of how these variables individually and collectively influence affordability. The results offer critical insights into how shifts in macroeconomic factors affect home-buying accessibility and shed light on the broader housing market trends over the last two decades.

#### Key Findings

The findings reveal nuanced dynamics between affordability and economic conditions:

1. **CPI and Inflation**: The positive and statistically significant relationship between CPI and the affordability index confirms that higher inflation leads to reduced affordability. Inflation, as measured by the CPI, directly correlates with rising housing costs because construction materials, labor, and overall living expenses increase. As CPI rises, potential homebuyers face higher costs not only for housing but also for other goods and services, reducing their disposable income for mortgage payments. This finding underscores the economic strain placed on individuals during periods of inflation and highlights the need for policies that mitigate inflationary pressures in housing markets.

2. **Housing Supply**: The negative coefficient associated with housing supply indicates that an increase in available housing improves affordability. When housing supply grows, competition among buyers decreases, stabilizing or reducing home prices. This relationship aligns with economic theory, which posits that greater supply relative to demand leads to price reductions. However, the relatively modest effect size suggests that while increasing supply is a necessary condition for improving affordability, it may not be sufficient on its own without addressing broader structural issues, such as zoning restrictions and construction costs.

3. **Interest Rates**: Interest rates exert the most substantial impact on affordability among the predictors. The strong positive coefficient indicates that rising interest rates significantly worsen affordability by increasing mortgage costs. For instance, a higher interest rate raises monthly payments, reducing the number of households that qualify for home loans. This finding emphasizes the critical role of monetary policy in shaping housing market accessibility. Policymakers must carefully consider the downstream effects of interest rate hikes, especially in a high-inflation environment where affordability is already strained.

Overall, the findings reinforce the interconnectedness of macroeconomic variables and housing market conditions. They also provide empirical evidence for policymakers and stakeholders to prioritize stabilizing inflation, increasing housing supply, and maintaining affordable interest rates to improve housing accessibility.

#### Weaknesses of the Analysis

While the analysis offers valuable insights, several limitations must be acknowledged:

1. **Model Fit and Scope**: The adjusted \(R^2\) values for the models range between 37% and 46%, indicating that the predictors explain less than half of the variation in the Affordability Index. This suggests that other unobserved factors—such as demographic shifts, wage inequality, or government policies—play significant roles in determining housing affordability. For instance, regional wage disparities or the availability of housing subsidies could significantly influence affordability but were not included in this analysis.

2. **Assumption Violations**: Diagnostic plots for the final model reveal minor deviations from the assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality of residuals. While these deviations are not severe enough to invalidate the results, they do suggest that a log transformation of variables or the use of non-linear models might improve the robustness of the analysis. Additionally, the presence of outliers, as indicated by the leverage plot, may slightly bias the estimates.

3. **Data Aggregation**: The analysis aggregates data at the national level, which limits its ability to capture regional variations in housing affordability. Housing markets in urban centers like San Francisco or New York operate under vastly different conditions than rural markets, and these distinctions are obscured in a national-level analysis. Future studies should aim to disaggregate data to better account for these geographic differences.

4. **Exclusion of Other Influential Variables**: Key factors such as household savings rates, employment stability, and government intervention programs (e.g., tax credits or housing subsidies) were not included due to data limitations. These factors likely play a critical role in shaping housing affordability but remain unexplored in this analysis.

Despite these limitations, the analysis provides a robust foundation for understanding the relationships between macroeconomic variables and housing affordability. Future work addressing these limitations could further strengthen the findings and provide actionable insights.

#### Future Directions

Building on the findings and addressing the limitations, future research should prioritize the following areas:

1. **Incorporating Additional Predictors**: Expanding the model to include variables such as wage growth, population density, and construction costs could enhance its explanatory power. For instance, wage growth relative to inflation could provide deeper insights into purchasing power, while construction costs could shed light on the supply-side challenges of the housing market.

2. **Regional Analysis**: Conducting state- or city-level analyses would allow for a more granular understanding of housing affordability trends. This approach could highlight regional disparities and inform localized policy interventions. For example, comparing affordability in high-cost metropolitan areas to that in rural regions could reveal targeted strategies for improving housing access.

3. **Exploring Non-Linear Relationships**: Future studies could employ non-linear modeling techniques, such as machine learning or interaction models, to capture more complex dynamics between variables. For example, the interaction between interest rates and inflation may have compounding effects on affordability that are not captured by a linear framework.

4. **Evaluating Policy Interventions**: Research focusing on the effectiveness of government programs, such as housing subsidies, rent control, or first-time homebuyer incentives, could provide actionable recommendations for policymakers. Evaluating these interventions in the context of affordability trends would help determine which policies have the most significant impact.

#### Conclusion

This paper contributes to the broader understanding of housing affordability by analyzing the interplay of inflation, housing supply, and interest rates. The findings emphasize the critical role of macroeconomic variables in shaping housing accessibility and highlight areas where policymakers can intervene to mitigate affordability challenges. While the analysis has its limitations, it lays the groundwork for future research to build more comprehensive models and address the pressing issue of housing affordability in the United States.
