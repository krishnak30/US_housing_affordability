**Figure Description and Implications:**  
The figure above illustrates the trends in interest rates over time, with a focus on the federal funds effective rate from 2008 to 2025. The graph shows distinct periods of fluctuation. From 2008 to 2015, interest rates remained historically low, hovering near zero due to monetary policy responses to the Great Recession. A gradual increase began in 2016, reflecting economic recovery and attempts to normalize monetary policy, before another sharp decline in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic spurred aggressive monetary easing to support the economy. Post-2022, the graph depicts a dramatic rise in interest rates, corresponding to central banks' efforts to combat inflationary pressures. This sharp increase represents one of the fastest monetary tightening cycles in recent history.

For the topic of housing affordability, these trends are crucial. Low interest rates, such as those seen during 2008–2015 and 2020–2021, generally reduce borrowing costs, making mortgages more affordable and stimulating demand in the housing market. Conversely, the sharp increases in interest rates post-2022 significantly raise mortgage rates, reducing affordability for new buyers and potentially cooling housing market activity. These trends underline the strong interplay between monetary policy and housing market dynamics, highlighting the importance of interest rate policies in influencing housing affordability over time.
