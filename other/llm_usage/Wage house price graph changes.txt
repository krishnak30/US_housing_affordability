user: oka now for the wage vs huose price graph which is this code:

#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-wages-vs-houseprices
#| fig-cap: 'Growth Rate of Wages and House Prices'

library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(arrow)

ggplot(analysis_data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = House Price (USD)), color = "green", size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Average Wage ($/Hour) * 10000), color = "blue", size = 1) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "House Price (USD)",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~./10000, name = "Average Wage ($/Hour)")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Housing Prices vs. Wages Over Time",
    x = "Year"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

i want to make the following changes:

1) y axis numbers should appear in full number format (e.g. 400,000) and make the lowest y value 0, don't start at 200 somthing
2) pick better colours for both lines. these are ugly colours
3) increase the gaps between all axis titles and the numbers as you did for me previously

chatgpt: Here is the updated code with all your requested changes:

```r
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-wages-vs-houseprices
#| fig-cap: 'Growth Rate of Wages and House Prices'

library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(arrow)

ggplot(analysis_data) +
  # House Price Line
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = `House Price (USD)`), color = "#FF5733", size = 1) +  # Bright orange for house prices
  # Average Wage Line
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = `Average Wage ($/Hour)` * 10000), color = "#3498DB", size = 1) +  # Cool blue for wages
  # Adjust y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "House Price (USD)",
    labels = scales::comma,  # Format y-axis numbers with commas (e.g., 400,000)
    limits = c(0, NA),  # Start y-axis at 0
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~./10000, name = "Average Wage ($/Hour)")
  ) +
  # Add labels and theme adjustments
  labs(
    title = "Housing Prices vs. Wages Over Time",
    x = "Year"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black", size = 0.5),      # Add x-axis line
    axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black", size = 0.5),      # Add y-axis line
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),         # Increase gap for x-axis title
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 15)),         # Increase gap for y-axis title
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(margin = margin(l = 15)),   # Increase gap for right y-axis title
    axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = "grey30"),                # Add x-axis ticks
    axis.ticks.y = element_line(color = "grey30"),                # Add y-axis ticks
    axis.ticks.length = unit(5, "pt")                             # Adjust tick length
  )
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Y-Axis Numbers in Full Format**:
   - Used `labels = scales::comma` to display numbers in comma-separated format (e.g., 400,000 instead of 400000).
   - Set `limits = c(0, NA)` to start the y-axis at 0.

2. **Better Line Colors**:
   - House Price Line: Bright orange (`#FF5733`) to stand out.
   - Wages Line: Cool blue (`#3498DB`) for a pleasant contrast.

3. **Increased Gaps Between Axis Titles and Numbers**:
   - Used `margin` to add spacing:
     - `axis.title.x` for x-axis title.
     - `axis.title.y` for left y-axis title.
     - `axis.title.y.right` for the secondary right y-axis title.

### Final Notes:
These changes will improve readability and aesthetic appeal. Let me know if you'd like to tweak the colors further or make any additional modifications!
