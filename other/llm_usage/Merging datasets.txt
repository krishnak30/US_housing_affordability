user: ok now let's do the merging on column at a time

chatgpt: Great! Letâ€™s start merging the datasets one column at a time.

Step 1: Merge cpi_data and interest_rate_data
Code to Merge:

R
Copy code
# Merge CPI and Interest Rate data by date
merged_data <- cpi_data %>%
  left_join(interest_rate_data, by = "date")

# View the first few rows of the merged dataset
head(merged_data)

# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(merged_data))
What to Check:

Ensure the merged dataset has columns for:
date
cpi
interest_rate
Verify there are no NA values in the cpi or interest_rate columns.

Step 2: Merge merged_data with income_data
Code to Merge:

R
Copy code
# Merge the previous merged data with Income data
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  left_join(income_data, by = "date")

# View the first few rows of the updated merged dataset
head(merged_data)

# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(merged_data))
What to Check:

Ensure the merged dataset now includes these columns:
date
cpi
interest_rate
average_wage
Verify there are no NA values in the average_wage column.

Step 3: Merge merged_data with house_price_data
Code to Merge:

R
Copy code
# Merge the previous merged data with House Price data
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  left_join(house_price_data, by = "date")

# View the first few rows of the updated merged dataset
head(merged_data)

# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(merged_data))
What to Check:

Ensure the merged dataset now includes these columns:
date
cpi
interest_rate
average_wage
house_price
Verify there are no NA values in the house_price column.

Step 4: Merge merged_data with house_supply_data
Code to Merge:

R
Copy code
# Merge the previous merged data with House Supply data
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  left_join(house_supply_data, by = "date")

# View the first few rows of the final merged dataset
head(merged_data)

# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(merged_data))
What to Check:

Ensure the final merged dataset includes these columns:
date
cpi
interest_rate
average_wage
house_price
house_supply
Verify there are no NA values in any of the columns.
