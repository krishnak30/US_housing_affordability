user: can you also come up with a title and subtitle for my paper. this is the rubric: An informative title is included that explains the story, and ideally tells the reader what happens at the end of it. 'Paper X' is not an informative title. Use a subtitle to convey the main finding. Do not use puns (you can break this rule once you're experienced).

and these are some good examples:

1) title: "Forecasting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: An Analysis of Battleground States"
subtitle: "Trump Favored Nationally, While Harris Leads in 4 of 7 Battleground States"

2) title: "Understanding the Impact of Mortgage State and Income on Household Poverty Status"
subtitle: "An Analysis of Household Poverty Status in the United States in 2019"

chatgpt: 

Here’s a title and subtitle for your paper that align with the rubric:

**Title**:  
"Analyzing Housing Affordability in the United States: The Role of Inflation, Interest Rates, and Supply"

**Subtitle**:  
"Rising Costs and Limited Supply Worsen Affordability, While Increased Housing Stock Offers Relief"

Let me know if you’d like a different tone or emphasis!
