user: amazing, now the last step is to design a survey. keep in mind this whole section that we just did. I need you to create a survey which will be conducted on google forms to help analyze housing affordability using themethods we just talked about. would you like an example survey that we created for out previous paper?


chatgpt: Yes, having an example survey would be incredibly helpful! It would provide a good starting point for structuring the new survey and ensuring that it aligns with both the methodology we’ve developed and the expectations of your paper. Once I review the example, I can craft a tailored survey for housing affordability that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative questions, as well as the sampling and data collection strategies we've outlined. Please share the example!
